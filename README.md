This is a project to analyze the impact of recession on the unemployment rates. 

1. The data was scraped using Fred API
2. Pre-processed the data to get the unemployment rates for the time period of 1980-2023
3. Compared with the unemployment rate at the time of COVID-19


The graph of Year vs unemployment rates is an interactive graph. Since GitHub does not support Plotly, we decided to take a snippet of the graph.
