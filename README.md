This project aims to assess the influence of recessions on unemployment rates through the following steps:

1. Data retrieval: Utilized the Fred API for scraping relevant data.
2. Data pre-processing: Processed the collected data to extract unemployment rates spanning the period from 1980 to 2023.
3. Comparative analysis: Examined and compared the unemployment rates during the COVID-19 period with historical data.

The interactive graph depicts the relationship between years and unemployment rates. Due to GitHub limitations with Plotly, a snapshot of the graph is provided for reference.
